    <h2>About JabberChess</h2>
    <p>JabberChess is a speech-activated chess application that allows users to use voice commands to play chess. Users can talk to the app to start a new game (as either side), play moves or request the location of the pieces on the chess board. This makes it a chess application that is truly accessible to visually impaired users. The standard chess algebric notation is used in the speech commands to make moves on the chess board. The app's voice and speech recognition functionalities are supported by Nuance Communications, a world-leading company in speech recognition technologies. JabberChess is also built on top of the open-source Stockfish chess program and engine, one of the strongest chess engines in the world.
